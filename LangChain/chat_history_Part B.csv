Abstract
This paper uses Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models to compute response of
structural system subject to Indian earthquakes at Chamoli and Uttarkashi
ground motion data. The system is first trained for a single real earthquake data.
The trained ANN architecture is then used to simulate earthquakes with various
intensities and it was found that the predicted responses given by ANN model
are accurate for practical purposes. When the ANN is trained by a part of the
ground motion data, it can also identify the responses of the structural system
well. In this way the safeness of the structural systems may be predicted in case
of future earthquakes without waiting for the earthquake to occur for the lessons.
Time period and the corresponding maximum response of the building for an
earthquake has been evaluated, which is again trained to predict the maximum
response of the building at different time periods. The trained time period versus
maximum response ANN model is also tested for real earthquake data of other
place, which was not used in the training and was found to be in good
agreement.
Keywords : Earthquake, Neural Network, Frequency, Structure, Building.
1 Introduction
Real earthquake ground motion at a particular building site is very complicated.
The response of a building to an earthquake is dynamic and for a dynamic
response, the building is subjected to a vibratory shaking of the base. Exactly
how a building responds is complex and depends on the amplitude and
frequency of vibration along with the material and design of the building. All
buildings have a ""natural frequency"" associated with them. If strain is placed on
to the structure and then let it snap back into equilibrium, it will sway back and
forth with an amplitude that decays with time. If the ground shakes with the same
frequency as a building's natural frequency, it will cause the amplitude of sway to
get larger and larger such that, the ground shaking is in resonance with the
building's natural frequency. This produces the most strain on the components of
the building and can quickly cause the building to collapse. Powerful technique of
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been used to model the problem for one
storey structure. Among the different types of ANN, the feedforward, multilayer,
supervised neural network with error back propagation algorithm, the BPN [1] is
the most frequently applied NN model. Dynamic response of a structure to strong
earthquake ground motion may be investigated by different methods. The
method, that has been used here, is to create a trained black box containing the
characteristics of the structure and of the earthquake motion which can predict
the dynamic response for any other earthquake for a particular structure.
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) have gradually been established as a powerful
soft computing tool in various fields because of their excellent learning capacity
and their high tolerance to partially inaccurate data. ANN has, recently been
applied to assess damage in structures. Stefano et al.[3] used probabilistic
Neural Networks for seismic damage prediction. Many methods viz. [4]-[9] were
introduced for response estimation and for structural control. Zhao et al.[10]
applied a counter-propagation NN to locate damage in beams and frames.
KuZniar and Waszczyszyn [11] simulated the dynamic response for prefabricated
building using ANN. Elkordy et al.[12] used a back-propagation neural network
with modal shapes in the input layer to detect the simulated damage of
structures. Muhammad [13] gives certain ANN applications in concrete
structures. Pandey and Barai [14] detected damage in a bridge truss by applying
ANN of multilayer perceptron architectures to numerically simulated data. Some
studies such as [15]-[17] used artificial neural network for structural damage
detection and system identification.
In the present paper, the Chamoli earthquake ground acceleration at Barkot (NE)
and Uttarkashi earthquake ground acceleration recorded at Barkot (NE and NW)
have been considered based on the authors' previous study [18]. From their
ground acceleration the responses are computed using the usual procedure.
Then the ground acceleration and the corresponding response are trained using
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with and without damping. After training the
network with one earthquake, the converged weight matrices are stored. In order
to show the power of these converged (trained) networks other earthquakes are
used as input to predict the direct response of the structure without using any
mathematical analysis of the response prediction. Similarly, the various time
periods of one earthquake and its corresponding maximum responses are
trained. Then the converged weights are used to predict the maximum response
directly to the corresponding time period. Various other results related to use of
these trained networks are discussed for future / other earthquakes.
2 Artificial Neural Network
Artificial neural systems are present day machines that have great potential to
improve the quality of our life. Advances have been made in applying such
systems for problems found difficult for traditional computation. A neural network
is a parallel, distributed information processing structure consists of processing
elements called neurons, which are interconnected and unidirectional signal
channels called connections. The general structure of the network that have
been used here is given in Fig.1. the structure consists of three layers : the input
layer, the hidden layer and the output layer. The input layer is made up of one or
more neurons or processing elements that collectively represent the information
in a particular pattern of a training set. The hidden layer also consists of one or
more neurons. Its purpose is simply to transform the information from the input
layer to prepare it for the output layer. The output layer, which has one or more
neurons, uses input from the hidden layer (which is a transformation of the input
layer) to produce an output value for the entire network. The output is used to
interpret the training and classification results of the network. The processing
elements or neurons are connected to each other by adjustable weights. The
input/output behaviour of the network changes if the weights are changed. So,
the weights of the net may be chosen in such a way so as to achieve a desired
output. To satisfy this goal, systematic ways of adjusting the weights have to be
developed, which are known as training or learning algorithm.

4 Response Prediction
The basic idea behind the proposed methodology is to predict the structural
response of single degree of freedom system i.e. single storey building subject to
various earthquake forces. Two cases viz without damping and with damping
have been considered for the analysis.
Case(i) : Without damping
Let M be the mass of the generalized one storey structure, K the stiffness of the
structure and x be the displacement relative to the ground then the equation of
motion may be written as:
&& &&
Mx+Kx = −Ma (1)
&&
x =Responseacceleration,
x =Displacement,
&&
a =Groundacceleration.
where,
Equation (1) may be written as,
& x& +ω2x = −a&& (2)
Where ω2=K/M, is the natural frequency parameter of the undamped structure.
The solution of equation (2) [Ref. 2] is given by
t
1
&&
x(t) = − ∫a(τ)sin[ω(t−τ)]dτ (3)
ω
0
From this solution the response of the structure viz. acceleration is obtained for
no damping.
Case (ii) : With damping
Let M be the mass of the generalized one storey structure, K the stiffness of the
structure, C the damping and x be the displacement relative to the ground then
the equation of motion may be written as:
M&x& +Cx& + Kx = −Ma&& (4)
where
&&
x =Responseacceleration,
&
x=Response velocity,
x =Displacement,
&&
a =Groundacceleration.
Equation (4) may be written as,
&x& +2ξωx& +ω2x = −a&& (5)
Where ξω = C/2M and ω2=K/M, is the natural frequency parameter of the
undamped structure.
The solution of equation (5) [Ref.2] is given by
t
1
&&
x(t) = − ∫a(τ)exp[−ξω(t−τ)]sin[ω(t−τ)]dτ (6)
ω
0
From this solution the response of the structure viz. acceleration is obtained for
damping.
Now, the neural network architecture is constructed, taking ground acceleration
as input and the response obtained from the above solution is taken as output for
each time step. Therefore, the whole network consists of one input layer, one
hidden layer with varying nodes and one output layer as shown in Fig.1. Similarly
for the other problem of time period vs. maximum response the input and output
layer contain the time period and the corresponding maximum response
respectively at each interval for the particular structure.
5 Numerical Results and Discussions
For the present study two Indian earthquakes viz. the Chamoli Earthquake (max.
ground acceleration =0.16885 m/sec/sec) at Barkot in NE (north–east) direction
shown in Fig.2(a) and the Uttarkashi earthquake (maximum ground acceleration
= 0.931 m/sec/sec) at Barkot in NE (north–east) and NW (north-west) direction
as given in Figs. 2(b) and 2(c) have been considered for training and testing.
Initially, the system without damping is studied and for that the ground
acceleration of Chamoli earthquake at Barkot (NE) was used to compute the
response for single storey structure using usual procedure from Eq.(3). The
obtained response and the ground acceleration is trained first for the assumed
frequency parameters ω=0.5 and ω=0.01 for time range 0 to 14.92 sec.(748 data
points) for the mentioned earthquake. Simulations have been done for different
hidden layer nodes and it was seen that the response result is almost same and
good for 5 to 20 nodes in the hidden layer. However, 10 hidden layer nodes are
used here to generate further results.
After training ground acceleration and response data for Chamoli earthquake at
Barkot (NE) for 10 nodes in hidden layer, the weights are stored and they are
used to predict responses for various intensity earthquakes. The plot in Fig. 3(a)
shows response comparison between neural and desired for the 80% of Chamoli
earthquake at Barkot (NE) for ω=0.01(maximum response=0.135079m/sec/sec).
Similarly, the response comparison for 120% Chamoli earthquake at Barkot (NE)
for ω=0.5 (Maximum response=0.20260 m/sec/sec) is shown in Fig 3(b).
Next, a part of the ground acceleration is used for the training and it will be
shown that the present ANN can predict the whole period of the response using
the trained ANN by the part of the data. So, the ground acceleration and
response data with Chamoli earthquake is trained for an example with the time
range 0 to 10.96 sec.(550 data points). Its weights are stored to find the
response for the time range 0 to 14.92 sec. (whole period) at different
percentages of the earthquake in order to test the network learning for the points
outside the training set. Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) show the response comparison
between neural and desired for ω=0.01, (maximum response=0.168849
m/sec/sec) and for ω=0.5 (maximum response=0.168841 m/sec/sec) at the time
range 0 to 10.96 sec. The response comparison between neural and desired for
ω=0.01 with 120% of the earthquake force (maximum response = 0.20260
m/sec/sec) from the time range 0 to 14.92 sec.(748 data points) is incorporated
in Fig. 5(a). It is obtained from the weights of the trained data for the time range 0
to 10.96 sec. (550 data points). From the same weights, neural responses for
80% of earthquake force, is computed with ω=0.5(maximum response=0.135073
m/sec/sec), for the time range 0 to 14.92 sec. (748 data points) and it is plotted in
Fig. 5(b).
The system with damping is then considered and for this, first from the ground
acceleration of Chamoli Earthquake at Barkot (NE), the response is computed
using Eq.(6). The obtained responses and the ground acceleration are trained by
the said ANN model for an example structural system with frequency parameter
ω= 0.68981 and damping = 1.58033. This training was done for the total time
range 0 to 14.92 sec. (748 points, earthquake period). Plot of 100% response
comparison between neural and desired for Chamoli Earthquake at barkot (NE)
is shown in Fig. 6(a). After training ground acceleration and response data for
Chamoli Earthquake for various nodes in the hidden layer it was confirmed that
10 nodes are again sufficient for the prediction. So, the weights corresponding to
10 hidden nodes are stored and they are used to predict responses for various
intensity earthquakes. The response for 50% (ω= 0.68981, damping = 1.58033
and maximum response = 0.00375 m/sec/sec) of the Chamoli Earthquake at
Barkot (NE) and its comparison with the desired response are shown in Fig. 6(b).
Similarly, the response comparison between neural and desired is shown in Fig.
6(c) (ω= 0.68981, damping = 1.58033 and maximum response for 120% =
0.00910 m/sec/sec) for 120% of earthquake acceleration.
Finally, the Uttarkashi earthquake at Barkot (NW) ground acceleration is used
with damping = 0.05, at different time periods ( t = 1/omega) ranging from 0.5 to
10 with an interval of 0.02 (620 data points) for evaluating the maximum
responses corresponding to each time period using Eq. (6). The obtained time
periods and the corresponding responses are trained and then the converged
weights are stored. The comparison between neural and desired results is shown
in Fig. 7(a). The stored weights were then used to predict the response for
different time periods lying in the same range of 0.5 to 10 but at different time
interval of 0.5 for another earthquake such as Uttarkashi earthquake at Tehri
(NW), The results are depicted in Fig. 7(b) showing good comparison between
ANN model and desired results.
6 Conclusions
This paper uses the powerful soft computing technique (Artificial Neural Network)
to compute structural response of single degree of freedom system subject to
Indian earthquakes at Chamoli and Uttarkashi ground motion data. Also this
technique is used to predict the maximum response corresponding to various
time periods. It is shown here that once the training is done then the trained
architecture may be used to simulate for various intensity earthquakes, thereby
showing the responses of the system which depend upon the structural
properties (mass and stiffness) of the structure. If the network is trained for
various time periods of one earthquake and its corresponding maximum
responses then the model can predict the maximum response directly to the
corresponding time period for any other earthquake that had not been used
during the training. In this way the safety of the structural systems may be
predicted in case of future earthquakes.

"What is the error backpropagation training algorithm (EBPTA), and how is it used in this study?","The Error Back Propagation Training Algorithm (EBPTA) is a method used in training artificial neural networks. In this study, it is used to adjust the weights in the network. The weights are the strengths of the connections between the neurons in the network, and adjusting them changes the input/output behavior of the network.

The process works as follows:

1. The algorithm is given a set of training pairs, which include inputs and desired outputs.
2. The algorithm computes an error value for the present neural network.
3. The error signal terms of the output and hidden layers are calculated.
4. The weights of the output layer and hidden layer are adjusted based on these error signal terms and a learning constant.

In the context of this research paper on predicting structural system responses to earthquakes, the EBPTA is used to train the neural network on ground acceleration and response data from earthquakes. Once trained, the network can be used to simulate responses for earthquakes of various intensities."
What did the response predictions show for varying earthquake intensities after training with the Chamoli earthquake data?,"After training with the Chamoli earthquake data, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model was able to predict responses for earthquakes of various intensities. The trained model was tested for 80% and 120% of the Chamoli earthquake's intensity. The results showed a good match between the predicted responses and the actual responses.

For instance, when tested with 80% of the Chamoli earthquake at Barkot (NE) for a frequency parameter ω=0.01, the maximum response was 0.135079 m/sec/sec. Similarly, for 120% of the Chamoli earthquake at Barkot (NE) for ω=0.5, the maximum response was 0.20260 m/sec/sec. These results suggest that the ANN model can accurately predict the responses of structural systems to earthquakes of various intensities. 

The model also showed its ability to predict responses to earthquakes not used in the training phase. This means that it can potentially predict the safety of structural systems in case of future earthquakes."
"Which parameters define the natural frequency of a structure, as per the document?","The natural frequency of a structure, denoted as ω² in the document, is determined by two key parameters: the stiffness of the structure, represented as K, and the mass of the structure, represented as M. The natural frequency parameter is calculated as ω² = K/M. 

This natural frequency is significant because if the ground shakes with the same frequency as a building's natural frequency, it can cause the building to sway with increasing amplitude, placing the most strain on the components of the building and potentially leading to collapse. This is why understanding and predicting the natural frequency of a building is crucial in earthquake-prone areas."
How many hidden layer nodes were found to be optimal for the ANN model's hidden layer?,"The researchers found that using between 5 to 20 nodes in the hidden layer of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model produced almost the same good results. However, for the sake of generating further results, they decided to use 10 nodes in the hidden layer. This was found to be sufficient for accurate prediction of the structural responses to various intensity earthquakes."
Which data set was used to validate the ANN model's predictions for time periods and maximum responses?,"The Uttarkashi earthquake at Tehri in NW direction was used to validate the ANN model's predictions for time periods and maximum responses. This data set was not used during the training phase. The ANN model, which was trained with the time periods and corresponding maximum responses from the Uttarkashi earthquake at Barkot in NW direction, was able to predict the maximum response directly to the corresponding time period for the Tehri earthquake. The results showed good agreement between the model's predictions and the actual data."
