The need fo r lasting change is permeating the organization and I want to express my gratitude to \\nour employees for embracing a new operating model and organizational structure, a renewed focus on our customer, and for their continued belief in our incredible brands.”  \\n\"The Gap Inc. Board of Directors and I have deep appreciation for and confidence in the work that has taken hold under Bobby Martin  and the Leadership Team, with results already showing progress, and \\nmore importantly, a collective focus on continued improvement still ahead. As we are engaged toward the appointment of a new Gap Inc. CEO to carry this work into the future, we look forward to the time \\nwhen we will introduce this great company’s next leader - one who will bring passion, vision and an \\nunwavering focus on the customer,” said Mayo Shattuck, Lead Independent Director, Gap Inc.  \\n \\nFirst  Quarter Fiscal 202 3 - Financial Results  \\n \\n• Net sales  of $3.28  billion , down 6 % compared to last year, inclusive of an estimated 1 -point \\nforeign exchange headwind and 2 percentage points of negative impact from the sale of Gap \\nChina.

The need fo r lasting change is permeating the organization and I want to express my gratitude to \\nour employees for embracing a new operating model and organizational structure, a renewed focus on our customer, and for their continued belief in our incredible brands.”  \\n\"The Gap Inc. Board of Directors and I have deep appreciation for and confidence in the work that has taken hold under Bobby Martin  and the Leadership Team, with results already showing progress, and \\nmore importantly, a collective focus on continued improvement still ahead. As we are engaged toward the appointment of a new Gap Inc. CEO to carry this work into the future, we look forward to the time \\nwhen we will introduce this great company’s next leader - one who will bring passion, vision and an \\nunwavering focus on the customer,” said Mayo Shattuck, Lead Independent Director, Gap Inc.  \\n \\nFirst  Quarter Fiscal 202 3 - Financial Results  \\n \\n• Net sales  of $3.28  billion , down 6 % compared to last year, inclusive of an estimated 1 -point \\nforeign exchange headwind and 2 percentage points of negative impact from the sale of Gap \\nChina.

Excluding $4 million in restructuring costs, adjusted gross \\nmargin of 37.2%  increased 570 basis points versus last year.  \\no Merchandise margin increased 600 basis points versus last year, or 610 basis points on \\nan adjusted basis,  due to  lower air freight expense  and improved promotional  activity  in \\nthe quarter , partially offset by inflationary cost headwinds.   \\no Rent, occupancy, and depreciation (ROD) deleveraged 40  basis points versus last year \\nprimarily due to lower online sales in the quarter.  \\n   \\n \\n   \\n • Reported operating loss was $10 million ; reported operating  margin of negative 0.3 %.  \\n• Adjusted  operating income was $18 million , exclud ing a $47 million gain related to the sale of an \\noffice building  and $75 million of restructuring costs ; adjusted operating margin of 0.5%.   \\n• The effective tax rate was 10 %.  \\n• Reported net loss  of $18 million ; reported diluted loss  per share of $ 0.05.  \\n• Adjusted net income of $ 3 million , excluding the gain on sale and restructuring costs ; adjusted \\ndiluted earnings per share of $0.01.  \\n \\nF\\nirst Quarter Fiscal 202 3 – Balance Sheet  and Cash Flow Highlights  \\n \\n• Ended the quarter with  cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 billion , an increase of 38% from the \\nprior year. \\n• Net cash from operating activities was $15 million.

Sales in the quarter were driven by \\ncontinued strength in the women’s category offset by continued softness in the active and kid ’s \\ncatego ries as well as continued slower  demand  from the lower -income consumer . \\n• Comparable sales were down 1 %. \\n \\nGap:  \\n• Net sales of $ 692 m illion , down 13%  compared to last year.  Excluding the  negative impact from \\nthe sale of Gap China, the shutdown of Y eezy  Gap and foreign exchange  headwind s, net sales \\nwere  down 1% versus last year driven by continued strength in the women’s category  offset by \\ncontinued softness in the active and kid ’s categories as well as strategic store closures  in North \\nAmerica. \\n• Comparable sales were up 1%. \\n Banana Republic:  \\n• Net sales of $ 432 million , down 10% on top of 24% growth last year.  Sales in the quarter were \\nimpacted as the brand lapped  outsized growth last year driven by the shift  in consumer \\npreferences .   \\n• Comparable sales were down  8%. \\n    \\n \\n   \\n Athleta:  \\n• Net sales of $ 321 million , down 11% compared to  last year.  Sales in the quarter were impacted \\nby continued product acceptance challenges .  \\n• Comparable sales were  down 13% .  \\n \\n \\nFiscal 2023 Outlook  \\n“As we look to the remainder of fiscal 2023, we believe we remain well positioned to drive continued \\nmargin expansion and improved cash flow relative to last year despite what we know continues to be an uncertain macro and consumer environment,” said Katrina O’Connell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gap Inc. “We continue t o believe we are taking the right steps toward positioning Gap \\nInc. back on its path towards sustainable, profitable growth and delivering value for our shareholders over the long term.”  \\nThe company’s outlook takes into consideration the continued uncertai n consumer and macro \\nenvironment.  \\nThe company is estimating second quarter net sales could decrease in the  mid to high -single  digit range  \\ncompared to last year’s net sales of $ 3.86  billion.  As a reminder, t he sale of Gap China to Baozun  Inc. \\nclosed on January 31, 2023. Second  quarter 2022 net sales included approximately $ 60 million in sales \\nfor Gap China.  \\n \\nThe company continues to anticipate  that fiscal 2023 net sales could decrease in the low to mid -single \\ndigit range compared to last year’s net sales of $15.6 billion .  As a reminder, fiscal 2022 net sales \\nincluded approximately $300 million in sales for Gap China. Fiscal 2023 will include a 53rd week \\nestimated to positively impact net sales by $150 million.     The company expect s second  quarter and fiscal 2023 gross margin expansion compared to the prior \\nyear. At the estimated level of sales described above, the company is planning adjusted SG&A of \\napproximately $1.3 billion in the second  quarter and continues to anticipate approximately  $5.2 billion \\nfor fiscal 2023.   \\n \\nThe company now expects fiscal 20 23 capital expenditures in the range of $500 million to $525 million, \\ncompared to its prior range of $500 million to $550 million, reflecting lower  capital project investments \\nand fewer Old Navy and Athleta store openings than previously contemplated.  \\n \\nWebcast and Conference Call Information  \\nCammeron McLaughlin, Head of Investor Relations at Gap Inc., will host a conference call to review the company’s first quarter fiscal 202 3 results beginning at approximately 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time toda y.  Ms. \\nMcLaughlin  will be joined by  Interim Chief Executive Officer Bob Martin and Chief Financial Officer \\nKatrina O’Connell.  \\n \\nA live webcast of the conference call will be available online at investors.gapinc.com . A replay of the \\nwebcast will be available at the same location.  \\n    \\n \\n   \\n Non -GAAP Disclosure   \\nThis press release and related conference call include financial measures that have not been calculated \\nin accordance with  U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and are therefore referred to \\nas non -GAAP financial measures. The non -GAAP measures described below are intended to provide \\ninvestors with additional useful information about the company’s financial performance, to enhance the \\noverall understanding of its past performance and future prospects  and to allow  for greater  \\ntransparency  with  respect to important  metrics  used  by managemen t for financial and operating \\ndecision -making.  The company  presents  these non-GAAP  financial measures  to assist  investors  in seeing  \\nits financial performance  from  management's  view  and because  it believes  they  provide  an additional  \\ntool for investors  to use in computing the company's  core  financial  performance  over  multiple  periods  \\nwith  other  companies  in its industry.  Additional  information  regarding  the intended  use of each  non-\\nGAAP  measure  included  in this press  release  and related  conference  call is provided  in the tables  to this \\npress  release.   \\n \\nThe non -GAAP measures included in this press release and related conference call are  adjusted gross \\nmargin, adjusted operating expenses/adjusted SG&A, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating \\nmargin, adjust ed net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and free cash flow , as well as \\nexpected adjusted operating expenses/adjusted SG&A . These non -GAAP measures exclude  the impact \\nof certain items that are set forth in the tables to this press release . Also note that a reconciliation of \\nexpected adjusted operating expenses/adjusted SG&A  is not provided, in reliance on the exception \\nprovided under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S -K, because a comparable GAAP measure  is not \\nreasonably accessible or reliable due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying measures \\nthat would be necessary for such reconciliation. Namely, we are not able to reliably predict the impact of many of the costs and expenses that may be incurred in the future  that could impact operating \\nexpenses/SG&A . In addition, we believe such a reconciliation would imply a degree of precision and \\ncertainty that could be confusing to investors. The variability of those  costs and expenses may be \\nmaterial and have a significant and unpredictable impact on our future GAAP results.  \\n The non -GAAP measures used by the company should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior \\nto, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted.  The company  urges  investors  to review  the reconciliation  of these  non-GAAP  \\nfinancial measures  to the most  directly  comparable  GAAP  financial measures  included  in the tables  to \\nthis press  release  below,  and not to rely on any single  financial measure  to evaluate  its business.  The \\nnon-GAAP  financial  measures  used  by the company  have  limitations  in their  usefulness  to investors  \\nbecause  they  have  no standardized  meaning prescribed  by GAAP  and are not prepared  under  any \\ncomprehensive  set of accounting rules  or principles.   \\n Forward -Looking Statements  \\nThis press release and related conference call contain forward -looking statements within the “ safe \\nharbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than \\nthose that are purely historical are forward -looking statements.
